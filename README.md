# Apex Configs
sorry they might be a little messy

## Start up parameters
You can add these in origin or at the end of your path in your desktop shortcut(helps if you have multiple accounts)
```-novid +fps_max unlimited -refresh 240 -dev -console -preload -forcenovsync -fullscreen -high +exec autoexec.cfg```

```-refresh``` add the hz of you monitor's refreshrate.
```-dev -console``` are to enable developer console and is cheat protected.
```-preload``` could cause stutters on some old systems. but will increse preformance on others.
```-high``` is to set the game process in high priority.

## Frame caping

Use RTSS for framerate caping as like most other game engines nothing beats RTSS in frame cap consistancy. I wish there was an equivalent that was open source
