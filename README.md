# Apex Configs
sorry they might be a little messy

## Start up parameters
You can add these in origin or at the end of your path in your desktop shortcut(helps if you have multiple accounts)


```-novid +fps_max unlimited -refresh 240 -dev -console -preload -forcenovsync -fullscreen -high +exec autoexec.cfg```


```-refresh``` add the hz of you monitor's refreshrate.
```-dev -console``` are to enable developer console and is cheat protected.
```-preload``` could cause stutters on some old systems. but will increse preformance on others.
```-high``` is to set the game process in high priority.

## Locations

```videoconfig.txt``` and ```settings.cfg``` go in 

```C:\Users\ (user) \Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local```

```videoconfig.txt``` should be set to read only. as making a video change in game will result in the file to reset.

```autoexec.cfg``` goes in the instalations path ```Apex/cfg/```

example ```E:\Games\Apex\cfg\autoexec.cfg```

## Frame caping

Use RTSS for framerate caping as like most other game engines nothing beats RTSS in frame cap consistancy. I wish there was an equivalent that was open source

## Other things notable 

```max_fps``` only works up to 144

binding a third key to an action

## to do

compare against mendo's autoexec when released

clean up

find away to bind to 3 keys
